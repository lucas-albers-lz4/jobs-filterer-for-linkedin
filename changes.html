      <h2>Jobs Filterer for LinkedIn change history</h2>
      <h3>Version 1.2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplified filtering logic with improved selectors and removal of legacy state management.</li>
        <li>Fixed exceptions so that manually excluded jobs now display correctly on the options page.</li>
        <li>Re-enabled and repositioned the manual filter button to the bottom of job cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 1.1</h3>

      <p>The name of the extension has been changed to "Jobs Filterer
        for LinkedIn" in the hope that this will satisfy trademark
        concerns expressed to me by representatives of LinkedIn in the
        form of forcing the add-on to be unpublished from the Chrome
        Web Store under its previous name. Also, disclaimers have
        been added spelling out explicitly that this add-on is not
        affiliatd with LinkedIn.</p>

      <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The extension now asks for the permissions it needs if
          they weren't granted automatically by the browser or the
          user revoked them.</li>
        <li>The Alt-S / Option-S key binding on the options page to
          save the options has been disabled on Firefox because the
          Firefox menu accelerators interfere with it and I've been
          unable to find a workaround for that.</li>
        <li>There is now a backup page linked to from the bottom of
          the options page that you can open to view a flat
          representation of your filter patterns so that you can save
          them to a local file as a backup in case you need to restore
          them later.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.9</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can now open the extension's options by clicking on
          its toolbar icon.</li>
        <li>The help page has been fixed so that it no longer says
          "above" to refer to where the extension options are, and
          instead links to the options page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.8</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>LinkedIn changed the format of their pages again, so our
          code needs to be modified again to accommodate their
          changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.7</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The extension now supports hiding specific jobs purely
          within the extension, without telling LinkedIn you don't
          want to see them. You should do this for jobs which are a
          good fit for you but you don't want to see anymore, e.g.,
          because you've already applied to them, so you don't
          influence LinkedIn's algorithm not to show you similar jobs
          in the future. To hide a job this way, click the funnel
          button that the extension adds to jobs next to the eye with
          the slash.</li>
        <li>You can now type Alt-S (Option-S on macOS) on the options
          page to save the options without moving focus from the text
          field you're currently editing.</li>
        <li>LinkedIn has changed the structure of the recommended jobs
          / job search results pages for at least some users (they
          appear to be rolling out this change gradually and not
          everyone has it yet). This change attempts to handle the new
          page format. If the extension suddenly stopped filtering
          jobs for you on some pages, this is probably the fix for
          that.</li>
        <li>The extension now keeps paying attention to a job even
          after you click its hide / unhide buttons. Previously once
          you clicked hide and then unhide the extension would ignore
          that job until you refreshed the page.</li>
        <li>The delay between when you unhide a job and when it is
          removed from the list of hidden jobs in the extension
          options (if it's there) has been made considerably
          shorter.</li>
        <li>Case-insensitive regular expressions are now supported;
          specify the regexp as "/regexp/i" to access this
          functionality.</li>
        <li>A race condition which sometimes caused some jobs not to
          be filtered properly has been fixed.</li>
        <li>A workaround has been implemented for a problem which was
          causing the extension to stop filtering jobs when it was
          updated in a running Chrome instance. <strong>Note:</strong>
          if you have LinkedIn loaded in a tab when the extension is
          updated in the background, you may still need to refresh
          that page to get the extension working again, but unlike
          before, you should no longer need to quit and restart Chrome
          entirely.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.5 which caused the
          extension to save changes when you clicked the
          "Save" button on the options pag even when nothing was
          changed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.6</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix: once any of the text boxes on the options page (i.e.,
          the title, company and location regular expression boxes,
          and the box listing specific filtered jobs) got to about
          8,192 characters it could no longer be saved. The
          implemention has been changed so now the only limit is about
          100,000 characters for all of the text boxes put together,
          which should be sufficient.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.5</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add this changelog page and make it open on install/update.</li>
        <li>New feature: if you "Undo" a job hide, and that job is
          listed in the extension options as having been explicitly
          hidden by you, then it now gets removed from that list
          automatically.</li>
        <li>Add automatically filtered jobs to the list at the top
          instead of the bottom, i.e., the list is now newest jobs
          first, so if you have the options page opened when you hide
          a job you'll see it show up at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>When the user hides a job, check whether it would already
          be filtered out by the currently configured regular
          expressions (presumably because the user just edited them to
          exclude it), and if so, don't add it to the list of
          explicitly filtered jobs.</li>
        <li>Fix automatic job filtering on click so that it works on
          the job search page; previously it only worked on the
          recommended jobs page.</li>
        <li>Fix bug which could cause the extension, when trying to
          hide a job on a company's page, to instead save it, i.e.,
          add it to the user's saved jobs.</li>
        <li>Move the extension help to a separate page.</li>
        <li>Make changes to the "Hide filtered jobs completely"
          checkbox on the options page save immediately instead of
          waiting for the user to click the "Save" button.</li>
        <li>Fix a bug which occasionally caused auto-filtered jobs to
          fail to be saved and attempts to save options to fail with
          the error, "This request exceeds the
          MAX_WRITE_OPERATIONS_PER_MINUTE quota."</li>
        <li>Implement some performance improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.4</h3>
      <p>(Version 0.4 was rightfully rejected by Google because it was
        buggy so it was never published.)</p>
      <h3>Version 0.3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter jobs automatically when the user clicks the
          hide button.</strong> You no longer have to edit regular
          expressions in the extension options to hide jobs. Now when
          you click the button to tell LinkedIn not to show you a job
          anymore (the eye with the slash through it), the extension
          remembers that automatically, and it subsequently hides the
          job reliably even if LinkedIn doesn't.</li>
        <li>Update the extension to accommodate changes in the format
          of LinkedIn's website code.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add an example workflow to the documentation on the
          options page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial release</li>
      </ul>
